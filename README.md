# state-feeder
An automatic logging system for recording the durations for which a generator operates and maintaining the logs in a database. This system involves a raspberry pi unit with an operating system installed within to enable interaction with the user, a voltage step down regulator for enabling the GPIO pins within the raspberry pi unit to be connected to the generator power supply, a storage device for maintaining the logs, and a power backup for powering up the unit. This system allows the user to have easy access to the running times of the generator in a tabular format and automates the process of calculation of fuel consumption and estimation for future fuel needs.
